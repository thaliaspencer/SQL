# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability), AVG(energy)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

#I then figured out what artist released the long song according to this dataset
SELECT track_name, artist_name, duration_ms
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1; 

#Next, I wanted to know the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity, AVG(danceability) 
FROM Spotifydata 
GROUP BY popularity 
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;  

#This listed the top 5 songs containing the most tempo 

SELECT track_name, artist_name, tempo
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY tempo desc
LIMIT 5; 

#And then I was able to learn all information regarding Doja Cats music on Spotify in 2021.

SELECT *
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
HAVING artist_name = 'Doja Cat';
